# NBA Player Data Scraper & Odds Calculator
This project focuses on scraping detailed performance data for all NBA players and using it to calculate over/under betting odds for every game in a season. The data was collected from basketball-reference.com, cleaned, and transformed for further analysis.

## Project Overview:
- **Data Scraping:** Leveraged web scraping techniques to automatically extract up-to-date player statistics from basketball-reference.com for all NBA players for their last 3 seasons.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Applied extensive data cleaning methods to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step involved handling missing data, removing duplicates, and transforming raw stats into a format suitable for calculation.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated expected values for key player metrics, including:
    - Steals
    - Blocks
    - Turnovers
    - 3-pointers<br>
Using historical data, I modeled projected future performance based on home/away games, minutes played, quality of opposing team and an average game of the player.
- **Odds Calculation for Over/Under Bets:** Based on the expected values, I calculated betting odds for various over/under markets. These odds were tailored to each player's expected performance for individual games.

## Highlights:
- Scraped gamelogs of players for the past 3 seasons.
- Focused on key stats that influence betting outcomes.
- Calculated expected values for key player metrics.
- Created odds for every player in every match for an entire season - over 50 000 records.
- This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and probability calculations for betting scenarios.
